# XYPlotterProject<br/>
This is code for a school project in which the program receives G-Codes from a drawing software and translates it to movement for a physical XY Plotter. It requires:<br/>
1. mDraw software
2. FreeRTOS installation
3. Physical XY Plotter hardware<br/>

The servo motor works on PWM which requires calibrating prior to running the program, as the values are dynamic and can be different based on different hardware.
